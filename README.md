BACKGROUND You are a Type 1 Diabetic craving a sugar rush. Your job, if you choose to survive, is to keep your blood sugar in the controlled zone so that your A1C is as healthy as possible as you platform through the stage. The bar in the top left corner of the screen is a constant glucose (blood sugar) monitor (CGM); it will measure sugar levels throughout the day. However, your A1C will be averaged based on measurements from ten evenly spaced time during the day. During this time, you need to both monitor your BS and reach the end of the stage.

BASIC RULES The ideal blood sugar is between 200 and 100, but the constraints become smaller and lower (the lowest ideal will be 80) with each progressive level. A BS of 100 is better than one of 200, but 99 is worse than 200. The adverse effects for having an unhealthy blood sugar are instant and get progressively worse the further it is from the target numbers. Instant Game Over if BS < 15 or BS > 800. Level 1 BS begins at 150.

Use candy/soda/caffeinated beverages as powerups → speed up But you have to take the right amount of insulin to cover the carbs Use needles and insulin as weapons against monsters (cravings and the temptation to cheat) Trying to reach the end with the fastest time (star ratings) Same status effects as before Having to avoid/collect insulin and carbs HUD: CGM at the top of the screen (High, In-Range, Low) A line of status effects: Dehydration → sweat drop, tongue out, water thought bubble Hunger → growling stomach Exhaustion → running slower (higher resistance), yawning Stress → dark cloud, furrowed eyebrows Pain → wincing, temporary, bandage Love Status Effect → heart eyes Keep a store of insulin that can be charged up? Some levels last more than “one day” and players are given the choice to rest for a set amount of time when the sun goes down? Slows down time, but avoids status effects Avoid becoming too hungry (eat within certain time periods) Total game score is determined by the (40%) time elapsed and (60%) your A1C.

GENRE Single-player 2D Platformer Health Education Simulation — Type 1 Diabetes

CONTROLS Control player using up, down, left and right on keyboard OR WASD Gather collectibles by running through them Shift to Run

INTERFACE Side view platformer Lighthearted vector art & warm color theme (pinks) Energetic music Color theme contrast decreases when BG is low (becomes more gray-scaled)

COLLECTIBLES Humalog Insulin → Cartridge Red = Good Burgundy = Expired Lantus Insulin → Purple Vial Needles → Green and Gray Caps

FOOD Caffeinated soda/coffee → Speedup + BS spike; Inc Dehydration Chocolate Bar/Ice Cream (fats) → Slow down treatment of hypos Smaller candies → Smaller BS spike Peanut Butter/Apples (protein/fiber) → Slow down digestion. No spike Pasta/Rice/Pizza (high carb meals) → Insulin Does Water → Stay hydrated! Alcohol → Lowers BS; Drunk status effect

ENEMIES Cupid → Lowers BS Unforeseen Carbs → Inc BS Artificial Sugar → Inc BS Existential Stress Clouds → Keeps BS high until removed (insulin is less effective) Common Cold → Lowers BS

MATH (changes after a few levels) Humalog carb ratio: 1:10 Correction factor: 1:30 Players determine the correct amount of insulin by playing a minigame similar to lock picking in Assassins’ Creed
